## Color Scheme

The color scheme I'm looking to use for this website is very minimalistic. I don't want the colors to be to bright and flashy, I want to keep the colors light and use colors such as white or grey. I want the user to feel relaxed when they are using the website. For this I used a hex colors #FFFFF
#68A357
#000000
#ADD8E6
#DCDCDC
