# Design Plan - MillenialMoney

## Page Wireframes
Provided below are the wireframe diagrams of the proposed web application. I wanted to keepo the website as  minimalistic and simple as possible. I want also wanted web application to be easy to use. The wireframe is designed for a larger web screen but will have the abilty to adapt to smaller screens. The investing/saving advice page will contain links to good articles, there will also be away to see the most recent articles put up on the site as well.

## Color Scheme

The color scheme I'm looking to use for this website is very minimalistic. I don't want the colors to be to bright and flashy, I want to keep the colors light and use colors such as white or grey. I want the user to feel relaxed when they are using the website. For this I used a hex colors #FFFFF
#68A357
#000000
#ADD8E6
#DCDCDC
