# Site Plan - 

## Overview

The aim of *Mike's Website* is to create a personal Blog about finance advice that will allow me to teach money-saving techniques and economical lifestyle tips. 

Money is everywhere. You canâ€™t escape it. Unfortunately, personal finance is not a required subject in most high schools or colleges.
