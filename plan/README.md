* *wisebread.com* is another site with alot of good information about how to save money and also what to do with the money you have saved. I really like all the good information that was given on the site. I personally found the site design to be a little busy and kind of boring. But its site itself isn't hard to follow and allows the user to get good information on how to use and save their money wisely

### Conclusion 

* I really liked both sites but feel that wisebread's site wasn't as appeasing to look at as investedwallet. I liked how both sites gave easy to understand information. I want to incorporate easy to follow/understand information in my site and will follow something similar to their sites. Easy to follow info is important to me since my site will be for young kids and adults and I dont want the information to be to complex and hard to follow. The same goes for my design, My design will be very simple. I found a really great site called *nataliebacon.com*. Natalie created an easy to follow site with great design and picutes.
